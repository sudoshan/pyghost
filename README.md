# walors 

# this project is incomplete, meaning its progress is still on-going.

walors is an implementation of pywal colors in ghostty. unlike pywal, instead of changing tty colors, walors directly changes the theming on ghostty as per your currrent pywal colors.

background-opacity option will get removed everytime the script is initialised due to clashing of the options 'background' and 'background-opacity'.
